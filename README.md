# Final Year Project - Modern E-commerce Frontend

This repository contains the source code for the frontend of a feature-rich, modern e-commerce platform. It is built using the latest web technologies, focusing on performance, scalability, and a great user experience. This project was developed as a final year university project.

The frontend is designed to work with a corresponding [.NET Core Web API backend](https://github.com/unsignedbuntu/FinalYearProject_Backend).

## üöÄ Key Features

This platform provides a complete e-commerce experience with a wide range of features for both customers and administrators.

### Core E-commerce Functionality
- **Product Catalog:** Browse products by category, with support for dynamic filtering and sorting.
- **Product Details:** View detailed product information, including descriptions, technical specifications, and customer reviews.
- **Shopping Cart:** A fully persistent shopping cart with functionality to add, update, and remove items, managed globally with Zustand.
- **Favorites/Wishlist:** Users can save products to multiple named wishlists for future reference.
- **Order Management:** Users can view their complete order history, check the status of each order (Pending, Shipped, Delivered), and see detailed item breakdowns.
- **Product Review System:** Authenticated users can submit ratings and written reviews for products they have purchased.

### User Account & Authentication
- **Secure Authentication:** JWT-based authentication with `HttpOnly` cookies for secure session management.
- **User Dashboard:** A central sidebar provides easy access to orders, favorites, profile settings, and more.
- **Account Management:** Users can sign up, log in, and log out securely.

### Advanced & AI-Powered Features
- **AI Image Generation with Multi-Layer Caching:** The platform integrates a powerful feature for generating images from text prompts using a Stable Diffusion model.
  - **Smart Caching:** To optimize performance and reduce redundant, costly API calls, a multi-layer caching strategy is implemented. When an image is requested, the system first queries a high-speed **Redis cache**. If it's a miss, it checks a persistent **database cache**. The Stable Diffusion model is only invoked if the image is absent from both caches.
  - **Dockerized Redis:** The Redis cache runs within a **Docker container**, ensuring a consistent and isolated environment for development and deployment.
  - **Frontend Integration:** This functionality is exposed to users on pages like `MyFollowedStores/page.tsx`, where they can input prompts to generate visuals. The request is handled by a dedicated `/api/ImageCache` Next.js API route.

- **Gamified Loyalty Program with Python Microservice:** A unique loyalty program enhances user engagement.
  - **Integration:** Users can access the game via the `loyalty-program/page.tsx` page, which triggers a `/api/run-game` endpoint.
  - **Decoupled Architecture:** This Next.js API route communicates with a separate, **Python-based microservice**. This microservice contains the game's logic, and its decoupled nature allows it to be developed, scaled, and maintained independently from the main frontend application.

### User Interface & Experience
- **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive layout built with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a seamless experience on all devices.
- **Interactive UI:** Modern UI elements like a mega menu for navigation, overlays, and modals for non-disruptive user interactions (e.g., sorting, signing in).
- **Global State Management:** Centralized state management using Zustand for cart, user session, and favorites, ensuring a consistent state across the application.
- **Notifications:** User feedback through success and error messages for actions like adding items to the cart.
